# KNN-Project

## iPhone Purchase Prediction
Project 5 - iphone_prj5
Iphone Purchases are getting increased day by day and many stores wants to predict whether a customer will purchase an Iphone 
from thier store given their gender, age and salary.

Objective  - Whether Customer will purchase or not

Tools - Python code in Jupyter notebook, Tableau for vizualization, Powerpoint, Excel.

Tableau Dashboard - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/najrul.ansari/viz/iphonepurchasedashboard/Dashboard1?publish=yes

Algorithm Used- KNeighborsClassifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LogisticRegression.

KNeighborsClassifier - KNeighborsClassifier is a classification algorithm based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach. 
It is part of the scikit-learn library in Python and is used for solving classification problems. 
KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm that classifies a new data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Decision Tree - A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. 
It works by recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets based on the values of different features. 
The objective is to create a tree-like structure of decisions, where each node represents a decision based on a particular feature, 
and each leaf node represents the predicted outcome.

Random Forest - A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and 
outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. 
It is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm known for its high accuracy and robustness.

LogisticRegression - Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification. 
Despite its name, it is a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm. 
It's commonly used in machine learning for predicting the probability that an instance belongs to a particular category.


## Bangalore House Price Prediction
Project 6 - houseprice_prj6
Objective - Predict the Price of Bangalore House


Tools - Python code in Jupyter notebook, Tableau for vizualization, Powerpoint, Excel.

Tableau Dashboard - 

Algorith Used - KNeighborsRegressor, Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial Regression.

KNeighborsRegressor - KNeighborsRegressor is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It is part of the scikit-learn library in Python and is based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach, similar to the KNeighborsClassifier for classification tasks. The KNN algorithm works by predicting the target variable of a new data point based on the average (or weighted average) of the target values of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space
Linear Regression - Linear Regression is a statistical method and a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable (also called the dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (independent variables). The relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear, meaning that a change in the predictor variables is associated with a linear change in the outcome.
